# Project: Register-Login-Website
# Version: 1.10

#Description:
This will be a mock website where a user can register an account with a username and password, and then login into their account.
This is a mock website register/login project that uses SQLite as its database system, HTML/CSS Front-End, and Python as its Back-End. <br>
This project is a way for me to practice Flask development, linking HTML/CSS Front-End to Python Back-End,
and database management actions including, but not limited to; 

- Accessing databases 
- Creating tables inside databases 
- Inserting data into the tables 
- Checking the contents of tables
- Connecting Front-Ends and Back-Ends together
- Developing Web Applications

# Current Features as of V-1.10:
- Program creates and connects to a database and creates a table if necessary
- A user can enter in a username and password to login 
- If they exist, they will be sent to a dashboard page, otherwise, they will be taken to the register page
- A user can register a profile with a username and password using a FlaskForm
- If the user tries to create an account that exists already, they will be not be logged in
- A user can now find and use the website online!

# Future Features to Implement:
- Display all information about the user who is logged in
- Improve the UI for the user
- Host this program on a server so people on the internet can find and register online (Completed)
