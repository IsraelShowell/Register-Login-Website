# Project: Register-Login-Website
# Version: 1.10

# Description:
This will be a mock website where a user can register an account with a username and password, and then login into their account.
This is a mock website register/login project that uses SQLite as its database system, HTML/CSS Front-End, and Python as its Back-End. <br>
This project is a way for me to practice Flask development, linking HTML/CSS Front-End to Python Back-End,
and database management actions including, but not limited to; 

- Accessing databases 
- Creating tables inside databases 
- Inserting data into the tables 
- Checking the contents of tables
- Connecting Front-Ends and Back-Ends together
- Developing Web Applications

# Notes:
ChatGPT, and other online tools were NOT extensively used to develop this code, they were mostly used to explain documentation and explain errors as I am still learning! <br>
